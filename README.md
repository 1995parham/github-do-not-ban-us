# Github Must Be a Free Platform

## Introduction

Github was a free platform for everyone since many years ago, but it has decided to restrict **Iranian accounts**.
I think living in a country is not a choice that you have, but being a developer and contributing to the open-source community is a choice. 
Github bans us from our freedom to contribute and being part of the open-source ecosystem because we are living in Iran.

**Github blocked our private repositories without any previous alert, and now we have no access to the codes**

You should not judge people based on their living country. You can restrict a government, but you should not ban your active and loyal users without any caution.

I think having a **simple Github page** is a basic right for users. 
Don't make us leave the open-source community.
