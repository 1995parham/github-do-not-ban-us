**Attention!**
We are so thankful for your support. This repository always shows that people are all together against unfortunate happening around the world.
As GitHub revised some of the previous restrictions, we decided to reduce this repository's activity. Of course, it does not mean that we agree with the sanctions and the GitHub.
We will post a conclusion and explain more soon, please wait for that.
The campaign will be terminated **Thursday 1 August 23:59 (Tehran Time GMT +4:30)**. After this time we won't merge any new PR. 
Once again thanks for your support and kindness
Please wait for our final conclusion

## Introduction

GitHub used to be an open and free platform for everyone, but it has decided to restrict Iranian accounts from contributing and being part of the open-source ecosystem. Although we understand GitHub might make this decision under the pressure of US government, we were expecting a more respectful action from GitHub.

1. GitHub restricted our access to private repositories suddenly, but at the very least we wanted GitHub to warn us before limiting our access.

2. GitHub decided to take one step further and ban every user that used Iran's IP address somewhere their history no matter where she/he is living, while they could just restrict access by IP address like other US-based companies. This action is kind of ban by nationality.

Eventually, we are hoping that GitHub's team will:

- Let us download our private repositories and gists and also make them public (setting control).
  **UPDATE:** It is possible now to make private repositories public, ~~however this option is not available on private gists (containing IDE Setting Sync files etc.) yet~~.
  **UPDATE:** It is now possible to make private gists public.
- Change their restriction policies so as to not limit users based on their Nationality.
- Announce their decision publicly and apologize for making this situation (like what Slack did before in the same situation: https://slackhq.com/an-apology-and-an-update).
- **UPDATE** GitHub Pages are now working for restricted persons.
